## Overview:
This project is the second of two steps in creating a full stack web application called myFlix. This stage of the project was to build all frontend components of the application resulting in a functional and hosted REST API with both a users database, and a movies database. In the next stage of this project the frontend of the myFlix App will be built resulting in a fullstack web application for searching and saving movies via a registered user account.

### Objective:
To build the client-side component of a “movies” web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies using t he previously built Movies-API.
